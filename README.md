# 👋 Hey, I'm Hrishikesh Pramod

I’m a Data & AI Engineer who loves building things that *work* — reliably, scalably, and with real impact.  
Right now, I work as a **Site Reliability Engineer – Data Platform at SLB**, where I design AI‑powered automation, build agentic workflows, and contribute to the backbone systems that global teams rely on every day.

My long‑term goal is simple:  
**Build trustworthy, high‑impact AI systems that empower people — not replace them.**

---

## 🚀 What I Do

### **Enterprise AI & Agentic Systems**
- Designed **LangGraph-based AI agents** that improved data pipeline SLAs to **98%** and brought down MTTR by **90%** — directly impacting thousands of pipelines.
- Built client-facing **text‑to‑SQL onboarding systems** that simplify data integrity workflows and reduce manual effort for end-users.

### **Data Engineering & Platform Reliability**
- Developed production-grade ETL pipelines and enterprise data models across HR and manufacturing domains.
- Delivered stakeholder-facing analytical solutions with **60% latency reduction**.
- Led validation and testing for large-scale SaaS analytics platforms across Finance & HR.

### **Human‑Centered Technical Problem Solving**
I’ve always gravitated toward roles that blend engineering with empathy — understanding real problems, mapping workflows, and designing solutions that make someone's life easier.

## 🏆 Achievements I'm Grateful For

### **🥇 Winner — NVIDIA Hackathon 2025**
Built autonomous agentic AI workflows using LangChain + ArangoDB for enterprise engineering automation.

### **🥇 Winner — MakeMIT (MIT), 2022**
Developed a real-time diagnostic system using integrated data streams and JS-based visualization.

### **🥈 Second Place — Baidu Edge AI & Robotics Challenge**
Built an OCR‑driven, on-device robotics perception module optimized for constrained hardware.

These competitions shaped my mindset:  
**move fast, stay calm, learn aggressively, and always finish with something that works.**

## 🧠 What I’m Passionate About

- Building **reliable GenAI systems** that the real world can trust  
- Designing **agentic workflows** that automate the tedious but elevate the human  
- Creating tools that genuinely help—whether it’s an end-user, a stakeholder, or an entire org  
- The intersection of **AI, systems engineering, and product thinking**  
- Learning new technologies deeply, from kernel programming to evaluation frameworks  

I believe great engineering comes from:
**curiosity + consistency + humility + real-world grounding**.

## 🌱 Current Journey

I’m constantly learning and pushing myself into areas where I’m a beginner again:

- Advanced agentic frameworks (LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI)
- RAG systems and evaluation strategies
- Kernel programming & performance engineering
- Building AI systems that are ethical, safe, and augment human capability

I aspire to work on problems that matter —  
problems that require both rigorous engineering and thoughtful human consideration.

## 🤝 What I Hope To Contribute

I love contributing to:
- AI tools that make developers’ lives easier  
- Open-source systems around reliability, observability, and safety  
- High-impact ideas that align with ethical technology and meaningful innovation  

My goal on GitHub is to document my journey openly — the wins, the experiments, and the things I’m still figuring out. If anything here resonates, I’d love to connect, collaborate, or just talk ideas.
